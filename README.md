# For Red Academy - Angular2 repository based upon minimalES6-v01

This repo is used for the Angular2 section of the Red Academy Web Dev
Course. It's based upon the minimalES6-V01 repo I created at

https://github.com/eapostol/minimalES6-v01.git

In addition, this repo attempts to merge the typeScript repo
mentioned in the slides, at 

https://github.com/Codesleuth/vscode-typescript-boilerplate

THIS GIT URL is at https://github.com/eapostol/ra_angular02_v01 


To use this repo:

1. Create a repo for your github profile, call it ra_angular02_v01.
2. For the description, enter in any details such as "angular2 starter"
3. Do not add a README or license.
4. In your terminal / command prompt, create a folder that will host 
the local copy of the repo files, calling it **ra_angular02_v01** or 
something that makes sense.
5. Then enter the following in your terminal / command prompt

git clone https://github.com/eapostol/ra_angular02_v01.git ra_angular02_v01

(assuming you are in a directory above the newly created ra_angular02_v01)

6. Use the **cd** command to enter into the ra_angular02_v01 folder

cd ra_angular02_v01

7. Then at the terminal / command prompt, run **npm install**
This should create the node_modules folder and add the packages.

8. You can then begin to install the Angular 2 and related modules,
following the instructions on the slides.

 hint: you may wish to make a 'working' branch, for example,
 calling it work_in_progress, separate from your master. 
 Then changes won't affect the "master" branch per se 
 ( and if you make a mistake you can always create another
 branch to work with ).
 
9. You may require / be asked to create a tslint.json file. 
A default one can be created in the command prompt/terminal by typing
 in the command

tslint --init

 
Good luck :)
